# TCP/IP Model

TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol and is a suite of communication protocols used to interconnect network devices on the internet.
TCP/IP is also used as a communications protocol in a private computer network (an intranet or extranet).

## 5 Layers of TCP/IP Model
1. Application Layer
   - Interact with users, Human, Computer Interface
3. Transport Layer
   - End to end verification, flow control, error correction.
5. Network Layer
   - Determine how the packages are routed across networks (through router A B C D ?)
7. Data Link Layer
   - Ensure frames are transferred correctly within the same LAN and resent with appropriate, Access control
9. Physical Layer
    - Transfer bits from one machine to another machine

## Examples of protocol used
1. FTP, HTTP, Telnet, SSH, Line, Skype
2. TCP, UCP
3. IPv4, IPv6, ICMP, RIP, OSPF
4. Ethernet, Token ring, IEEE 802.11
5. Infared, Bluetooth, WiFi, Fiber, Copper Wire, etc. 

### Data Units
1. Email -> Email message, Web -> Web page
2. TCP -> Segment, UDP -> Datagram
3. Packet (or IP datagram)
4. Frame
5. Bit
